# ACTrainer

This code is an example of how to create a game trainer or a hack cheat code for single player PC games. It shows how you can read or modify values from the process memory of the game. You can modify the game to get more/infinite ammo, health or grenades. To test the code make sure you download the version v1.1.0.4 of the AssaultCube game as the memory addresses changed in newer releases of the game.

Requirements:
* https://github.com/vsantiago113/ReadWriteMemory
* https://github.com/assaultcube/AC/releases/tag/v1.1.0.4

The game of AssaultCube v1.1.0.4 is just so you don't have to find the pointers. If you use a different game or version then you will have to find the addresses and the pointers.
